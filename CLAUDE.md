# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project created using the `createnewproject` script with the "basic" template. The project follows a simple structure with a virtual environment, basic Python module, and test framework.

## Development Setup

1. **Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment before development:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Common Commands

### Running Code
- **Run main script**: `python main.py`

### Testing
- **Run all tests**: `pytest`
- **Run specific test file**: `pytest tests/test_main.py`
- **Run with verbose output**: `pytest -v`

### Development
- **Install new packages**: `pip install <package_name>` then update `requirements.txt`
- **Generate requirements**: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Main application entry point
- `tests/` - Test directory containing pytest test files
- `venv/` - Python virtual environment (excluded from git)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Architecture Notes

This is a basic Python project template with:
- Single main.py module as entry point
- Pytest for testing framework
- Virtual environment for dependency isolation
- Git repository with standard Python .gitignore

The project was generated by `main.sh` which is a script that creates new Python projects with various templates (basic, flask, jupyter, fastapi, cli). This particular instance uses the "basic" template.

## Testing Framework

Uses pytest as the testing framework. Test files should be placed in the `tests/` directory and follow the naming convention `test_*.py`.
